In the second case place the coin inside the glass. Right now both coins will be visible. But when you pour water in the first glass the coin will disappear. But the coin in the second glass will still be visible despite the water. This happens because of the refraction of light."

So even as the water level in the bottle decreases and comes down a constant pressure is always maintained at the bottom end of the long straw. So the water falls with the same pressure until the water level in the bottle comes down below the straw end. Then, as expected the water pressure decreases and the water falls closer to the bottle.�"
